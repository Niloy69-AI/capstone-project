      <h2>Coding</h2>

      <p>
        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
        Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web
        development can range from developing a simple single static page of
        plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and
        social network services.

      <h2>Football</h2>

      <p>
        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
        kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally
        means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
        used. Sports commonly called football include association football
        (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States,
        and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football;
        Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football,
        arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football;
        rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms
        of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as
        "football codes".

      <h2>Mobile gamer</h2>

      <p>
        A mobile game is a video game that is typically played on a mobile
        phone.[1] The term also refers to all games that are played on any
        portable device, including from mobile phone (feature phone or
        smartphone), tablet, PDA to handheld game console, portable media player
        or graphing calculator, with and without network availability.[1] The
        earliest known game on a mobile phone was a Tetris variant on the
        Hagenuk MT-2000 device from 1994.
